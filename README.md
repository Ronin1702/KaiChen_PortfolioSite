## Usage

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building  
single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio  
of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an  
open position
```

* Workflow:

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section  
for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with  
titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact,  
and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is  
highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the  
navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short  
bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer‚Äôs applications  
with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding  
GitHub repository
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address,  
and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering  
text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer‚Äôs  
proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer‚Äôs GitHub  
and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform
