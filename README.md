## Description

This is the first personal portfolio site that I made at the first week as a  Full Stack Developer Student. There are not much to showcase besides some basic frontend skills that involves only CSS and HTML and basic JavaScript. I will keep updating this site as I learn more skills and technologies.

* Featuring Vite, V.2 is Now On [Netlify](https:kaichen-3000.netlify.app)

## Usage

```js
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

* Workflow:

```js
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
